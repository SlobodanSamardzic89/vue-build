## Basic VueJs build system with webpack, vue-loader and hot reload
 
This boilerplate is to help you setup a Vue build system from scratch so that you can bootstrap with the libraries you need, decouple them and customize according to your needs.
 
 For beginners, it's better to be able to control your build and add to it rather than tweak others and run the risk or breaking it. That being said, there are some great Vue boilerplates out there you can learn from as well.
 
 This one is just barebones, you get to add in your tests, minification et al.
